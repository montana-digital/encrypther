## The Privacy Crisis

Your medical records, home address, and even dating app data can be sold legally — **because the U.S. still has no national privacy law protecting you.**

While the European Union has GDPR and California has CCPA, most Americans have no comprehensive federal protection for their personal data. Data brokers can legally buy and sell your most sensitive information without your consent.

<!-- section:what-we-do -->
## What We're Fighting For

EncryptHer advocates for comprehensive federal privacy legislation that would:

### Comprehensive Data Protection
- Give individuals control over their personal data
- Require consent before data collection and sale
- Mandate transparency in data practices
- Provide the right to access, correct, and delete personal data
- Establish penalties for violations

### Close the Data Broker Loophole
- Regulate data broker practices
- Require opt-in consent for data sales
- Mandate regular data removal requests
- Establish oversight and enforcement mechanisms
- Protect sensitive categories of data (health, financial, location)

### Digital Rights for All Americans
- Equal protection across all states
- Clear enforcement mechanisms
- Support for individuals seeking to protect their privacy
- Regular updates to keep pace with technology
- International privacy standard alignment

<!-- section:current-situation -->
## The Current State of Privacy Law

### What Exists
- **GDPR (EU)**: Comprehensive privacy protection for EU residents
- **CCPA (California)**: State-level privacy rights for California residents
- **State Laws**: Various state-level privacy laws with limited scope
- **Sector-Specific Laws**: HIPAA (health), GLBA (financial), COPPA (children)

### What's Missing
- **No federal comprehensive privacy law** covering all Americans
- **Limited enforcement** of existing state laws
- **Data broker regulation** is minimal and inconsistent
- **No opt-out rights** at the federal level for most data types
- **Geographic inequality** — residents of some states have more rights than others

### The Impact
- **300+ data broker sites** selling your information
- **$200 billion industry** built on personal data
- **Stalking and harassment** enabled by easy access to personal information
- **Identity theft** and fraud facilitated by data broker sales
- **Targeted harassment** using purchased personal data
